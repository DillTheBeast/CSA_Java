Let's go through each question:

1. To print a value that is 1 more than twice the value of n, you can use the following:

I. int result = 2 * n; result = result + 1;
II. int result = n + 1; result = result * 2;
III. int result = (n + 1) * 2;
The correct answer is (E) II and III.

2. Evaluate the expression: a + b / c * 2

a + (b / c * 2) = 5 + (8 / 3 * 2) = 5 + 16/3 = 25/3
The correct answer is (E) 14.
3. The code segment performs the following operations:

c = a; d = b;
c += 3; (increment c by 3)
d--; (decrement d by 1)
num = c; num /= d; (convert c to double, then divide by d)
The correct answer is (B) The code segment stores the value of (a + 3) / (b - 1) in the variable num.

4. The code segment has an error. The correct answer is (C) In the expression (double) (sum / 2), the cast to double is applied too late, so the average will be greater than the expected result for even values of sum.

5. The code segment prints the result of 9 / 4, which is 2.25, and then prints the cast to int, which is 2. The correct answer is (E) 2.25 2.0.

6. Evaluate the expressions:

double x = (int) (5.5 - 2.5); (evaluates to 3.0)
double y = (int) 5.5 - 2.5; (evaluates to 3.0)
System.out.println(x - y); (prints 0.0)
The correct answer is (C) 0.0.

7. The code segment compiles without error. The correct answer is (A) The code segment compiles without error.

8. Evaluate the expression: int y = (int) x * 2; (convert x to int and then multiply by 2). The correct answer is (A) 8.

9. The correct answer is (C) final double pi = 3.14159; double d = 1.5; double c;

10. Evaluate the code segment step by step. The correct answer is (C) 9.

11. The correct answer is (B) II only.

12. The correct answer is (C) double avgScore; int count;

13. The correct answer is (D) Hello System.out.println !!!

14. The correct answer is (C) y = x; x = temp;

15. The correct answer is (B) The value of num is the square its original value.

16. The correct answer is (A) int onesDigit = num % 10; int tensDigit = num / 10;

17. The correct answer is (D) II and III.

18. Evaluate the code segment step by step. The correct answer is (E) 16.

19. Evaluate the code segment step by step. The correct answer is (D) The code segment leaves k unchanged and increases count by 2.

20. The correct answer is (E) AP CS A.

21. Evaluate the code segment step by step. The correct answer is (C) 14.

22. The correct answer is (D) In lines 1, 2, and 3, the text that appears in parentheses should be enclosed in quotation marks.

23. The correct answer is (E) The code segment works as intended.

24. The correct answer is (B) * **.

25. The correct answer is (D) Changing print to println in lines 2 and 3 only.

26. The correct answer is (A) The code segment works as intended.

27. The correct answer is (C) int x = 7 / 4;.
